Adrenal Cancer Causes, Risk Factors,
and Prevention
Learn about the risk factors for adrenal cancer and if there are things you might be able
to do to help lower your risk.
Risk Factors
A risk factor is anything that affects your chance of getting a disease such as cancer.
Learn more about the risk factors for adrenal cancer.
● Adrenal Cancer Risk Factors

Prevention
Since there are no known preventable risk factors for this cancer, it is not possible to
prevent this disease.
● Can Adrenal Cancer Be Prevented?
A risk factor is anything that increases your chances of getting a disease, such as
adrenal cancer. Having a risk factor, or even many, does not mean that you will get the

disease. Many people with risk factors never develop adrenal cancer, while others with
this disease have few or no known risk factors.
Certain adrenal cancer risk factors that are related to personal behaviors, such as
smoking can be changed. Others, like a person’s age, genetics, and family history can’t
be changed.
● Genetic syndromes
● Lifestyle and environmental factors
Genetic syndromes
Most adrenal cortex cancers are not inherited (they are sporadic), but some (up to 15%)
are caused by a genetic defect. This is more common in adrenal cancers in children.
Li-Fraumeni syndrome
The Li-Fraumeni syndrome1
is a rare condition that is most often caused by a defect in
the TP53 gene. People with this syndrome have a high risk of developing several types
of cancer, including breast cancer2
, bone cancer3
, brain cancer4
, and adrenocortical
cancer.
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
People with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have large tongues, are tall, and have an
increased risk for developing cancers of the kidney5
, liver6
 and adrenal cortex.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1)
People with MEN1 have a very high risk of developing tumors of 3 glands: the
pituitary7
, parathyroid, and pancreas8
. About one-third to one-half of people with this
condition also develop adrenal tumors. In most cases, these adrenal tumors are
adenomas (benign) and non-functional (do not make hormones). However, some
adenomas might be functional and make hormones, such as aldosterone and cortisol.
Adrenal adenomas usually do not cause any symptoms. This syndrome is caused by
defects in a gene called MEN1. People who have a family history of MEN1 or pituitary,
parathyroid, pancreas, or adrenal cancers should ask their doctor if they might benefit
from genetic counseling9
.
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
2
American Cancer Society cancer.org | 1.800.227.2345 ____________________________________________________________________________________
People with this syndrome10develop hundreds of polyps in the large intestine. These
polyps will lead to colon cancer if the colon is not removed. FAP patients may also
develop tumors elsewhere, like the adrenal glands. But, most adrenal tumors in people
with FAP are benign adenomas. This syndrome is caused by defects in a gene called
APC.
Lynch syndrome or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)
Lynch syndrome 11 (formerly known as HNPCC) is an inherited genetic disorder that
increases the risk of colorectal cancer12, stomach cancer, and some other cancers,
including adrenocortical cancer. In most cases, this disorder is caused by a defect in
either the MLH1 or MSH2 gene, but other genes13 can cause Lynch syndrome,
including MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM.
Lifestyle and environmental factors
Risk factors such as excess body weight, living a sedentary lifestyle, and being exposed
to cancer-causing substances in the environment can affect a person's risk of many
types of cancer. Smoking, in particular, has been suggested as a risk factor for adrenal
cancer.

What Causes Adrenal Cancer?

We do not know exactly what causes most adrenal cancers. Over the past several
years, there has been a lot of progress in understanding how certain changes in a
person's DNA can cause cells in the adrenal gland to become cancerous.
DNA is the chemical in our cells that makes up our genes, which control nearly
everything the cells do. We usually look like our parents because they are the source of
our DNA. But DNA affects more than just the way we look. It also determines our risk for
developing certain diseases, including certain types of cancer.
● Genes that help our cells grow and divide are called oncogenes.
Genes that slow down cancer cell division or make them die at the right time are
called tumor suppressor genes.
●
Cancers can be caused by DNA mutations (changes) that turn on oncogenes or turn off
tumor suppressor genes. Some people with cancer have inherited DNA mutations from
a parent, which increase their risk for developing the disease. But most DNA mutations
that are seen in cancers happen after birth rather than having been inherited. Some of
these mutations may result from exposure to things like radiation or cancer-causing
chemicals. But most of these mutations seem to happen for no apparent reason, without
having an outside cause.
Some of the DNA mutations that cause adrenal tumors in people with genetic
syndromes are discussed in Adrenal Cancer Risk Factors. If you have adrenal cancer,
it may be worthwhile to consider genetic testing1
 to find out if you have one of these
syndromes. If you do, you (and your family members) might have an increased risk of
developing other cancers also.
TheLi-Fraumeni syndrome2
is caused by inherited mutations that inactivate the TP53
tumor suppressor gene. This syndrome causes a small number of adrenal cancers in
adults (about 1 of every 20), but it's often the cause of adrenal cancer in children. In
fact, about 8 of every 10 cases of adrenal cancer in children are caused by Li-Fraumeni
syndrome. Many other adrenal cancers have also been found to have TP53 gene
changes that were acquired after birth (not inherited).

Because adrenal cancer is quite rare, we do not yet have a way to prevent it . However,
it is always important to follow general recommendations to lower cancer risk, such as:
● Avoid smoking
● Avoid exposures to cancer-causing chemicals
Consider genetic testing if you have a family history of adrenal cancer or related
cancers.
