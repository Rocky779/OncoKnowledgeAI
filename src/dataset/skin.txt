you can do to lower your risk of getting it. If you are at higher risk because of certain
factors, there are also things you can do that might help find it early1

What is a risk factor?
A risk factor is anything that raises your risk of getting a disease such as cancer.
Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors, like smoking and excess
sun exposure, can be changed. Others, like your age or family history, can’t be
changed.
Having a risk factor, or even many risk factors, does not mean that you will get
melanoma. Many people with risk factors never get melanoma. And some people who
get it may have few or no known risk factors.
Several risk factors can make a person more likely to develop melanoma.
Ultraviolet (UV) light exposure
Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays is a major risk factor for most melanomas. Sunlight is
the main source of UV rays. Tanning beds and sun lamps are also sources of UV rays.
While UV rays make up a very small portion of the sun’s rays, they are the main cause
of the damaging effects of the sun on the skin. UV rays damage the DNA (genes) inside
skin cells. Skin cancers can begin when this damage affects the genes that control skin
cell growth.
The pattern and timing of the UV exposure may play a role in melanoma development.
For example, melanoma on the trunk (chest and back) and legs has been linked to
2
American Cancer Society cancer.org | 1.800.227.2345 ____________________________________________________________________________________
frequent sunburns (especially in childhood). This might also have something to do with
the fact that these areas aren’t constantly exposed to UV light. Some research suggests
that melanomas that start in these areas are different from those that start on the face,
neck, and arms, where the sun exposure is more constant.
And different from either of these are melanomas on the palms of the hands, soles of
the feet, or under the nails (known as acral lentiginous melanomas), or on internal
surfaces such as the mouth and vagina (mucosal melanomas), where there has been
little or no sun exposure.
To learn more about the effects of UV rays on the skin and what you can do to protect
yourself and your loved ones, see Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation2 and How Do I Protect
Myself from Ultraviolet (UV) Rays?3
Moles
A mole (also known as a nevus) is a benign (non-cancerous) pigmented tumor. Babies
are not usually born with moles; they often begin to appear in children and young adults.
Having many moles: Most moles will never cause any problems, but someone who
has many moles is more likely to develop melanoma.
Atypical moles (dysplastic nevi): These moles look a little like normal moles but have
some features of melanoma. They are often larger than other moles and have an
abnormal shape or color. (See Signs and Symptoms of Melanoma Skin Cancer4
for
descriptions of how moles and melanomas look.) They can appear on skin that is
exposed to the sun, as well as skin that is usually covered, such as on the buttocks or
scalp.
Dysplastic nevi often run in families. A small percentage of dysplastic nevi may develop
into melanomas. But most dysplastic nevi never become cancer, and many melanomas
seem to arise without a pre-existing dysplastic nevus.
Dysplastic nevus syndrome (atypical mole syndrome): People with this inherited
condition have many dysplastic nevi. If at least one close relative has had melanoma,
this condition is referred to as familial atypical multiple mole and melanoma
(FAMMM) syndrome.
People with this condition have a very high lifetime risk of melanoma, so they need to
have very thorough, regular skin exams by a dermatologist (a doctor who specializes in
skin problems). Sometimes full-body photos are taken to help the doctor recognize if
3
American Cancer Society cancer.org | 1.800.227.2345 ____________________________________________________________________________________
moles are changing and growing. Many doctors recommend that these patients be
taught to do monthly skin self-exams5 as well.
Congenital melanocytic nevi: Moles present at birth are called congenital melanocytic
nevi. The lifetime risk of melanoma developing in congenital melanocytic nevi is
estimated to be between 0 and 5%, depending on the size of the nevus. People with
very large congenital nevi have a higher risk, while the risk is lower for those with small
nevi. For example, the risk for melanoma is very low in congenital nevi that are smaller
than the palm of the hand, while those that cover large portions of the back and
buttocks (bathing trunk nevi) have significantly higher risks.
Congenital nevi are sometimes removed by surgery so that they don’t have a chance to
become cancer. Whether doctors advise removing a congenital nevus depends on
several factors, including its size, location, and color. Many doctors recommend that
congenital nevi that are not removed should be examined regularly by a dermatologist
and that the person should be taught how to do monthly skin self-exams.
Again, the chance of any single mole turning into cancer is very low. However, anyone
with lots of irregular or large moles has an increased risk for melanoma.
Lighter skin, hair, and eye color
The risk of melanoma is much higher for people with lighter skin color than for people
with darker skin.
Among people with lighter skin, those with red or blond hair, blue or green eyes, or skin
that freckles or burns easily are at increased risk.
Family history of melanoma
Your risk of melanoma is higher if one or more of your first-degree relatives (parents,
brothers, sisters, or children) has had melanoma. Around 1 in 10 people with melanoma
have a family history of the disease.
The increased risk might be because of a shared family lifestyle of frequent sun
exposure, a family tendency to have lighter skin tone, certain gene changes (mutations)
that run in a family, or a combination of these factors.
For some people with a strong family history of melanoma, doctors might advise genetic
counseling and testing to see if they have gene mutations that increase their risk.
4
American Cancer Society cancer.org | 1.800.227.2345 ____________________________________________________________________________________
Personal history of melanoma or other skin cancers
A person who has already had melanoma has a higher risk of getting melanoma again.
In people who’ve had several melanomas or who’ve had melanoma at an early age,
doctors might advise genetic counseling and testing to see if they have gene mutations
that increase their risk.
People who have had basal or squamous cell skin cancers are also at increased risk of
getting melanoma.
Having a weakened immune system
A person’s immune system helps the body fight off cancers of the skin and other
organs. People with weakened immune systems (from certain diseases or medical
treatments) are more likely to develop many types of skin cancer, including melanoma.
For example, people who get organ transplants are usually given medicines that
weaken their immune system to help prevent them from rejecting the new organ. This
increases their risk of melanoma.
People infected with HIV6
, the virus that causes AIDS, often have weakened immune
systems and are also at increased risk for melanoma.
Being older
The risk of melanoma increases as people age, but melanoma can also develop in
younger people. In fact, melanoma is one of the most common cancers in people
younger than 30 (especially younger women).
Melanoma that runs in families may occur at a younger age.
Being male
In the United States, men are more likely than women to get melanoma, although this
varies by age. Before age 50, the risk is higher for women; after age 50, the risk is
higher in men.
Xeroderma pigmentosum
5
American Cancer Society cancer.org | 1.800.227.2345 ____________________________________________________________________________________
Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare, inherited condition that lowers skin cells’ ability
to repair damage to their DNA. People with XP have a high risk of developing
melanoma and other skin cancers when they are young, especially on sun-exposed
areas of their skin.

While there are many known risk factors for melanoma, it’s not always exactly clear how
they might cause cancer.
For example, while most moles never turn into a melanoma, some do. Researchers
have found some gene changes inside mole cells that may cause them to become
melanoma cells. But it’s still not known exactly why some moles become cancerous
while most don’t.
● Gene changes that might lead to melanoma
● Acquired gene mutations
● Inherited gene mutations
● Gene mutations can sometimes affect treatment
Gene changes that might lead to melanoma
DNA is the chemical in each of our cells that makes up our genes, which control how
our cells function. We usually look like our parents because they are the source of our
DNA. But our genes affect more than just how we look.
Some genes control when our cells grow and divide into new cells, repair mistakes in
DNA, or cause cells to die when they’re supposed to. If these genes aren’t working
properly, it can lead to cells growing out of control. For example:
Changes in genes that normally help cells grow, divide, or stay alive can lead to
these genes being more active than they should be, causing them to become
oncogenes. These genes can result in cells growing out of control.
●
Genes that normally help keep cell division under control or cause cells to die at the
right time are known as tumor suppressor genes. Changes that turn off these
●

genes can result in cells growing out of control.
Some genes normally help repair mistakes in a cell’s DNA. Changes that turn off
these DNA repair genes can result in the buildup of DNA changes within a cell,
which might lead to them growing out of control.
●
Mutations or other changes in any of these types of genes might lead to cells growing
out of control. Changes in several different genes are usually needed for a cell to
become a cancer cell. To learn more, see Oncogenes, Tumor Suppressor Genes, and
DNA Repair Genes1
.
Acquired gene mutations
Most often, gene changes related to melanoma are acquired during a person’s lifetime
and are not passed on to a person’s children (inherited). Sometimes these acquired
mutations seem to happen randomly within a cell, without having a clear cause. At
other times, they likely happen as the result of exposure to an outside cause.
For example, ultraviolet (UV) rays2 are a major cause of melanoma. Most UV rays come
from sunlight, but some can come from man-made sources such as tanning beds. UV
rays can damage the DNA in skin cells. Sometimes this affects certain genes that
control how the cells grow and divide. If these genes no longer work properly, the
affected cells may become cancer cells.
In many cases a melanoma might not appear until many years after the DNA damage
from UV rays has been done. Children and young adults often get a lot of intense sun
exposure that might not result in cancer until many years or even decades later.
The most common change in melanoma cells is a mutation in the BRAF oncogene,
which is found in about half of all melanomas. Other genes that can be affected in
melanoma include NRAS, CDKN2A, and NF1. (Usually only one of these genes is
affected.)
Melanomas that start on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nails
(known as acral lentiginous melanomas), or on internal surfaces such as the mouth
and vagina (mucosal melanomas), often have different gene changes than those in
melanomas that develop in sun-exposed areas, such as changes in the C-KIT (or just
KIT) gene.
Inherited gene mutations
8
American Cancer Society cancer.org | 1.800.227.2345 ____________________________________________________________________________________
Less often, people inherit gene changes from a parent that clearly raise their risk of
melanoma.
Familial (inherited) melanomas most often have changes in tumor suppressor genes,
such as CDKN2A (also known as p16), CDK4, or BAP1, that prevent these genes from
doing their normal job of controlling cell growth. This could eventually lead to cancer.
For some people who have a strong family history of melanoma or who have had
several melanomas (or melanomas that started at an early age), doctors might advise
genetic counseling and testing to see if they have a mutation in one of these genes (or
possible other genes) that increases their risk.
Some people, such as those with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), inherit a change in
one of the XP (ERCC) genes, which normally help to repair damaged DNA inside the
cell. Changes in one of these genes can lead to skin cells that have trouble repairing
DNA damaged by UV rays, so these people are more likely to develop melanoma,
especially on sun-exposed parts of the body.
Gene mutations can sometimes affect treatment
Some of the gene changes found in melanoma cells have proven to be good targets for
drugs to help treat this disease. For example, drugs that specifically target cells with
changes in the BRAF gene or the KIT gene are now used to treat advanced melanomas
with these changes (see Targeted Therapy for Melanoma Skin Cancer3
).

There is no sure way to prevent melanoma. Some risk factors, such as your age,
natural skin color, and family history, can’t be controlled. But there are things you can
do that could lower your risk of getting melanoma and other skin cancers.
● Limit your exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays
● Avoid weakening your immune system (when possible)
Limit your exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays
The most important way to lower your risk of melanoma is to protect yourself from
exposure to UV rays1
. Practice sun safety when you are outdoors.
10
American Cancer Society cancer.org | 1.800.227.2345 ____________________________________________________________________________________
Seek shade
Simply staying in the shade is one of the best ways to limit your UV exposure.
Slip! Slop! Slap!® and Wrap!
If you are going to be in the sun, this catchphrase can help you remember some of the
key steps you can take to protect yourself from UV rays:
● Slip on a shirt.
● Slop on sunscreen.
● Slap on a hat.
● Wrap on sunglasses to protect the eyes and sensitive skin around them.
Avoid using tanning beds and sunlamps
Many people believe the UV rays of tanning beds are harmless. This is not true.
Tanning lamps give off UV rays, which can cause long-term skin damage and can
contribute to skin cancer. Tanning bed use has been linked with an increased risk of
melanoma, especially if it is started before a person is 30 years old. Most
dermatologists (skin doctors) and health organizations recommend not using tanning
beds and sun lamps.
Protect children from the sun
Children need special attention, since they tend to spend more time outdoors and can
burn more easily. Parents and other caregivers should protect children from excess sun
exposure by using the steps above. Children need to be taught about the dangers of too
much sun exposure as they become more independent.
To learn more about sun safety
For more on how to protect yourself and your family from UV exposure, see How Do I
Protect Myself from Ultraviolet (UV) Rays?2
Watch for new, changing, or abnormal moles
Checking your skin regularly may help you spot any new or abnormal moles or other
growths and show them to your doctor before they even have a chance to turn into skin
11
American Cancer Society cancer.org | 1.800.227.2345 ____________________________________________________________________________________
cancer.
Certain types of moles are more likely to develop into melanoma (see Melanoma Skin
Cancer Risk Factors). If you have moles, depending on how they look, your doctor may
want to watch them closely with regular exams or may remove some of them if they
have features that suggest they might change into a melanoma.
Routine removal of many moles is not usually recommended as a way to prevent
melanoma. Some melanomas develop from moles, but most do not. If you have many
moles, getting careful, routine exams by a dermatologist, along with doing monthly skin
self-exams3
, might be recommended.
If you find a new, unusual, or changing mole, you should have it checked by a doctor
experienced in recognizing skin cancers. See Signs and Symptoms of Melanoma Skin
Cancer4
for descriptions of what to look for.
Avoid weakening your immune system (when possible)
Having a weakened immune system increases your risk of getting melanoma and other
types of skin cancer.
Infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, can weaken the immune system.
Avoiding known risk factors for HIV infection, such as intravenous (IV) drug use and
having unprotected sex with many partners, might lower your risk of skin cancer, as well
as many other types of cancer. (For more information, see HIV Infection, AIDS, and
Cancer5
.)
Some people need to take medicines to suppress their immune system. This includes
people who have had organ transplants and some people with autoimmune diseases.
People with cancer also sometimes need to take medicines such as chemotherapy,
which can lower their immune function. For these people, the benefit from taking these
medicines will likely far outweigh the small increased risk of getting skin cancer.

Gene mutations (changes) that increase melanoma risk can be passed down through
families (inherited), but these account for only a small portion of melanomas.
You might have inherited a gene mutation that increases your risk of melanoma if:
Several (typically at least 3) members on one side of your family have had
melanoma
●
13
American Cancer Society cancer.org | 1.800.227.2345 ____________________________________________________________________________________
● You have had 3 or more melanomas
● You have had melanoma at an early age (typically before age 45)
You or other family members have also had other cancers that might be from an
inherited genetic syndrome (such as pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, or brain
tumors)
●
The most common gene changes in families with high rates of melanoma are mutations
in the CDKN2A gene (also known as p16). Genetic tests for changes in this gene have
been available for several years, although it hasn’t always been clear how useful they
are. In part, this is because people with any of the factors above are already known to
have a higher risk of melanoma whether they carry a mutated CDKN2A gene or not, so
it’s not always clear how genetic testing results would change what a person does (or
what a doctor would recommend).
In recent years, researchers have found inherited changes in other genes that are
linked with an increased risk of melanoma. While changes in some of these genes
seem to be linked mainly with melanoma, changes in other genes result in inherited
syndromes that increase the risk of other cancers, as well as melanoma. For example:
Changes in the BRCA2 gene are most often linked with increased risks of breast
and ovarian cancers, but they’re also linked with some other cancers, including
melanoma.
●
Changes in the PTEN gene are linked with breast, uterine, and thyroid cancer, as
well as melanoma.
●
Changes in the TP53 gene can result in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which is linked with
increased risks of breast cancer, sarcoma, and brain tumors, as well as melanoma.
●
Changes in the BAP1 and MITF genes have also been linked with other cancers in
addition to melanoma.
●
With advances in technology in recent years, the costs of genetic testing have come
down, and testing can now be done to look for changes in several different genes at the
same time. Still, most melanoma experts don’t recommend genetic testing for all people
with a personal or family history of melanoma. Testing is more likely to be helpful if you
have any of the factors in the list above, or if your family history includes some of the
cancer types listed above.
Whether or not your doctor recommends genetic testing – and which gene changes
would be tested for – will depend on how likely it is that you might have an inherited
gene change.
14
American Cancer Society cancer.org | 1.800.227.2345 ____________________________________________________________________________________
If you’re considering genetic testing, it’s very important to meet first with a genetic
counselor or other health professional with knowledge of genetic testing. They can
describe the tests to you and explain what the results may or may not tell you about
your risk. Genetic testing is not perfect, and sometimes the tests might not provide clear
answers. To learn more about genetic testing, see Genetic Testing for Cancer Risk1
.
Regardless of whether genetic testing is done, people with a strong personal or family
history of melanoma should talk to their doctor about getting regular skin exams,
learning to do skin self-exams2
, and being particularly careful about sun safety3
.
